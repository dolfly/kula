# Custom Metrics

Kula can chart **anything** you can measure. Define chart groups in `config.yaml`, then push
JSON values into a Unix domain socket. Each group becomes a chart card; each metric in the
group becomes a line on that chart.

## 1. Define groups in config

```yaml
applications:
  custom:
    cpu_fans:
      - name: fan1
        unit: RPM
        max: 5000
      - name: fan2
        unit: RPM
        max: 10000
    room_temp:
      - name: ambient
        unit: °C
        max: 50
```

Each metric has:

- **`name`** — the series name (must match the key you send).
- **`unit`** — label shown on the chart (e.g. `RPM`, `°C`, `req/s`).
- **`max`** — Y-axis maximum for the chart.

These definitions are exposed to the frontend via `/api/config`, so the dashboard knows the
units and bounds for each custom chart.

## 2. Send data to the socket

Kula creates a Unix socket at `<storage.directory>/kula.sock`. Send a JSON object whose
`custom` field maps group names to arrays of `{name: value}` objects:

```bash
echo '{"custom":{"cpu_fans":[{"fan1":4423},{"fan2":8512}]}}' \
  | socat - UNIX-CONNECT:/var/lib/kula/kula.sock
```

You can send from any language that can write to a Unix socket. A polling script can push
values on the same interval as Kula's collection loop.

## 3. View

The new chart cards appear under the **Applications** section of the dashboard automatically
once data arrives.

## Example: a polling script

A reference Python example ships at [`scripts/custom_example.py`](../../scripts/custom_example.py),
and an NVIDIA exporter that feeds GPU data lives at
[`scripts/nvidia-exporter.sh`](../../scripts/nvidia-exporter.sh).

A minimal shell loop:

```bash
SOCK=/var/lib/kula/kula.sock
while true; do
  rpm1=$(cat /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/fan1_input 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
  printf '{"custom":{"cpu_fans":[{"fan1":%s}]}}' "$rpm1" \
    | socat - UNIX-CONNECT:"$SOCK"
  sleep 1
done
```

## Notes

- The socket path follows `storage.directory`; if Kula fell back to `~/.kula`, the socket is
  there instead.
- Group and metric names should be stable — they key the charts. Values may be integers or
  floats. Sending the same name twice in one message keeps only the last value.
- Custom metrics are stored alongside everything else in the tiered ring-buffer, so they have
  history and appear in downsampled views too.
- **Staleness.** A group stops reporting once its producer goes quiet, leaving a gap on the
  chart rather than a frozen line. The window defaults to a few `collection.interval` cycles;
  set `applications.custom_stale_after` (e.g. `10s`) to override. Push roughly on the
  collection interval to keep a feed live.
